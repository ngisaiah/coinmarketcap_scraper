This project showed taught me the puppeteer framework and opens the doors to data analysis with node. One of the biggest obstacles is being able to select all the 100 Table rows or Coins. This is occurred because they do not all have on class. The only attribute they have is 'style' and the first 11 values are different from the other 89 coins. After figuring out how to target the 2nd value of style I was faced with another bug where only 8 coins would be console logged or addded to coins.json. I would like to be able to scrape all the coins from the table and display the appropiate  data.
